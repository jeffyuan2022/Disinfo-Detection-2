            <h1>AI-Powered Misinformation Detection</h1>
            <p>Welcome! This site explores how we’re using AI to detect and combat misinformation. We combine predictive and generative models to assess the credibility of online content.</p>

            <h2>What’s This All About?</h2>
            <p>
                Misinformation and disinformation are everywhere, making it harder to separate fact from fiction. Our project combines machine learning with generative AI 
                to analyze news articles, rank their credibility, and provide explanations for how truthful (or misleading) they might be.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Scraping and Storing News Content</h3>
            <p>
                We collect online news articles, break them into smaller chunks, and store them in a <strong>vector database</strong>. 
                This allows us to efficiently analyze and compare pieces of text.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 2: Predictive Model - Fact Checking with Data</h3>
            <p>
                Using machine learning, we assess news credibility based on factors like writing style, sentiment, and linguistic structure. 
                Our model gives each article a <strong>veracity score</strong> from 0 to 1 (completely false to fully truthful).
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Generative AI - Deep Language Understanding</h3>
            <p>
                We use <strong>Google Gemini</strong> and an advanced method called <strong>Fractal Chain of Thought (FCoT) prompting</strong>. 
                This helps refine AI responses to ensure consistency and contextual accuracy when assessing misinformation.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Bringing It All Together</h3>
            <p>
                The predictive model and generative AI work together to improve fact-checking. Our system is designed to be interactive, 
                allowing users to query and explore misinformation detection results through a simple interface.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
            <p>
                The spread of misinformation affects public trust, decision-making, and even democracy. 
                By combining AI-driven techniques, we’re working toward a scalable, reliable system for detecting and mitigating false information.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>
                We’re refining our system, adding more factuality factors, and enhancing the UI for a better user experience. 
                Stay tuned as we continue improving our approach to misinformation detection!

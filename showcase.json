        "Explanation": "While the article still primarily relies on NHTSA and Tesla's statements, this iteration acknowledges the lack of other viewpoints as a limitation.  The suggestion to include perspectives from consumer advocacy groups or independent safety experts remains a valid recommendation for enhancing the article's balance."
